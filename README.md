## Indian Outfit Visualization System
In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving fashion landscape, where choices can be overwhelming, consumers are increasingly turning to online platforms to discover and purchase their favourite clothing and accessories. However, navigating the vast array of fashion choices available online can be daunting, often leaving users overwhelmed and unsure of where to begin their search. Our system “Elegance Echo” is an AI-driven web application that offers fashion recommendations and generates outfits based on user preferences. By understanding your fashion needs and preferences, it offers tailored advice on how to create stylish and on-trend Indian outfits. 

The objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a text-to-image generator tailored specifically for Indian fashion recommendations. By using deep learning techniques, machine learning algorithms, and large-scale fashion datasets, our system aims to bridge the semantic gap empowering users to translate their style preferences into tangible visualizations with ease.

Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion model that generates AI images from text. Instead of operating in the high-dimensional image space, it first compresses the image into the latent space. •	Latent diffusion models are machine learning models designed to learn the underlying structure of a dataset by mapping it to a lower-dimensional latent space. 

In a world where the fashion industry is constantly evolving and the choices seem endless, our system plays a pivotal role in helping individuals navigate the exciting landscape of fashion. To meet the growing demand for visually driven, personalized recommendations, we came up with the development of a system that takes user preferences for clothing and employs advanced image generation and search technologies. This innovative technology goes beyond simple outfit suggestions.

# Limitation: 
-> Disfigurement of faces in generated images, impacting realism and user experiences.: During output generation, it was observed that generated images frequently showcased distorted or blurry facial features. This significantly detracts from the overall image quality and realism, potentially hindering user adoption and satisfaction.
-> Heavy reliance on specific prompts to achieve desired results, limiting user flexibility.: While the model demonstrates an ability to produce diverse outputs, achieving specific details or styles often requires very precise and detailed prompts. This limits user creativity and exploration, potentially making the experience less intuitive and engaging.
